# You may revery to your previous commit (undoing a commit)
# You need to identify how many commit you want to travel back, so if you look at the git log, you can count 1 (after the HEAD commit) or foreach commit you want to go back to.
# In the example below you want to go back to the last 1 commit
# This will discard any changes made after commit history you are going for
16. git reset --hard HEAD~1

# By default git reset will use --soft if --hard, you can use --soft if you want to go back to a commit hisotry but do not want to discard your working files
17. git reset HEAD~1 
17. git reset --soft HEAD~1
