# you can connect your local code to a repository if the project was not created via a repository.
# this will create the .git file to track the files for your local repository
1. git init 

# connect your local repo to the remote repo.
# origin - the name of the destination (origin is the common name for the remote repository)
# <remote-repo location> - is the git address of the repo
2. git remote add origin <remote-repo location>
Example: git remote add origin git@github.com:sheenilim08/OfficeDocs-Support.git

# connect the branches on each repos
# origin - the name of the destination (origin is the common name for the remote repository)
# master - is the local branch in your local repository you want to connect to the remote repository
3. git push --set-upstream origin master

# update your local branch with all the changes from the remote repo (includes brances)
4. git pull

# common branch prefix names 
# main, dev, feature, bugfix
# example git branch bugfix/ticket-2445

# create a branch in your local repo
5. git branch <branchname>

# switching to a branch
6. git checkout branchname

# listing all branches
7. git branch

# creating and switch to new branch
8. git checkout -b branchname

# pushing local branch changes to remote repo, this would be very similar to item 3
# origin - would be the master branch of the remote repository
# <branchname> - is the local branch name you are working on to push to the remote repo
9. git push --set-upstream origin <branname>

# deleting branches
# when a branch from the remote repo is deleted, you should also delete your local copy
10. git branch -d <branchname>

# pull and merge your changes
# this pulls any changes from the remote repo and commit any changes to your local branch (merging them), them Pull request it again to the remote repo.
# if there are files that git cannot resolve, you will need to intervine on which lines of code you need to keep
11. git pull -r

# Once .gitignore is populated with files or folders to ignore, you will need to tell git to stop monitoring it from its previous tracked state.
12. git rm -r --cached <folder_or_file>

# Git Stash - is a state where you can temporarily put your working changes to a saved state
# this may come in handy if you want to switch branches but you dont want to discard your current working files.
# you will need to be in the brach you are working on before issuing the command.
13. git stash
14. git stash pop -> to reopen your working files.

# show all previous commits - commits will be shown as hash
# you can switch to the previous versions of your working files based on the the last commit checking branch,
# git checkout <hashcode>
15. git logs

# You may revery to your previous commit (undoing a commit)
# You need to identify how many commit you want to travel back, so if you look at the git log, you can count 1 (after the HEAD commit) or foreach commit you want to go back to.
# In the example below you want to go back to the last 1 commit
# This will discard any changes made after commit history you are going for
16. git reset --hard HEAD~1

# By default git reset will use --soft if --hard, you can use --soft if you want to go back to a commit hisotry but do not want to discard your working files
17. git reset HEAD~1 
17. git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Once you made your changes you can update your commit to update your commit message
18. git commit --ammend "message"

# it is discourage to use git reset, since it will mess up the chain if other devs are working on it.
# use git revert instead, which will create a new commit on the branch you are working on.
19. git revert <commit_hash>

# merging your branches
# you will need to switch to the branch you want to merge you code with. This would preferably a parent branch of the branch you are working.
# example below assumes you are in master branch and you want to merge the changes on the branch bugfix/ticket-2441
20. git merge bugfix/ticket-2441
