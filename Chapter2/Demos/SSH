# Generating Keys for SSH
# This is done on the workstation
1. ssh-keygen -t rsa -f .ssh/id_rsa -N passphrase
# -f is the private key file and should remain on the workstation. file name can be changed
# This will also create a .pub file (id_rsa.pub) which can be used to import to a remote server for ssh connection
2. cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub file and copy the contents

# this is done on the Server
3. open the .ssh/authorized_keys on the remote server
4. on a new line, paste the contents of the id_rsa.pub
# SSH from this point should now be passwordless

# Optional, if key is not provided the default key is used which is .ssh/id_rsa on the workstation is used.
5. ssh username@IP_ADDRESS -i .ssh/id_rsa2
6. scp file.txt root@IP_ADDRESS:/file.txt -i .ssh/id_rsa2
